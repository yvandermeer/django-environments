Building the documentation locally
==================================

Documention is provided in Sphinx format in the ``docs`` subdirectory of the 
project. Assuming you have completed a
:doc:`development installation </installation/develop>`, you can build the HTML
version of the documentation yourself::

    $ cd docs
    $ make html

Alternatively, you can browse the built documentation on `Read the Docs <rtd_>`_.
