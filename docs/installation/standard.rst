Regular install from PyPI
=========================

.. seealso::
    :doc:`/installation/requirements`

Installing |project| into your existing Django project as a regular Python 
package is easy::

    $ pip install django-environments

This installs two things:

1. A ``djenv`` Python package containing some default :ref:`settings modules <available-settings>` you can
   "extend" from.
2. A set of :doc:`Bash scripts and Shell functions </usage/commands>` for easily switching between Django settings and 
   projects.

For more information on using |project|, see :doc:`/usage/index`.
