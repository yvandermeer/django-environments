Credits & contributing
======================

.. highlight:: sh

The |project| project was originally started by `Goeie Jongens <gj_>`_ and most
of its code was written by `Vincent Hillenbrink <vmh_>`_.

Minor contributions have been made by `Yuri van der Meer <yvdm_>`_, including 
its release to PyPI_.

.. note::

    |project| was originally created as a private Mercurial repository and later
    on it started being pushed to Bitbucket_ periodically. That version is meant 
    to be included into your project as an "external" Mercurial repository -- it 
    does not use Setuptools/distutils.

    In February 2015, it was migrated to Github_ (using 
    `git-remote-hg <git_remote_hg_>`_) and packaged using Setuptools for 
    distribution through PyPI_.

    The version as it exists on Github should be considered a fork of the 
    original version on Bitbucket.

If you want to contribute to |project|, feel free to 
`fork the project on Github <github_fork_>`_.
