Installation
============

.. seealso::
    :doc:`requirements`

Installing |project| into your existing Django project is easy::

    $ pip install django-environments

This installs two things:

1. A ``djenv`` Python package containing some default settings modules you can
   "extend" from.
2. A set of Bash scripts for easily switching between Django settings and 
   projects.

For more information on using |project|, see :doc:`usage`.
