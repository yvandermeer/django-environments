# Initialize the environment
# Should be sourced with the 'source' command, e.g. 'source initenv'
# This can be done from virtualenvwrapper's bin/postactivate, but
# it's easier to just copy the following lines to bin/postactivate:

PROJECT_ROOT=/Users/grone/repos/django-environments
DJANGO_PROJECT=mysite
PROJECT_SETTINGS=settings.env.local
SHOW_DJANGO_ENVIRONMENT=yes

source $PROJECT_ROOT/scripts/initenv_generic
