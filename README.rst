django-environments
===================

Manage different Django settings within a Django project, and easily
select settings from the command line or from WSGI. Different
settings can be helpful either on a single computer, but
django-environments is also intended for use on different system
environments, such as development, test, staging/acceptance and
production, all with "maximum DRYâ„¢".
